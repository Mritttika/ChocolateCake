Recipe:

Mix all the ingredients(except melted milk chocolate) ncely and smoothly. When poured batter must form a ribbon-like structure. Grease a cake mould with butter or refined oil. Pour the batter. Set the power to 60% and microwave the cake for 7-8 mins. Insert a toothpick to check if it's cooked or not. If the cake sticks to the toothpick, then it needs to be cooked fr a minute or so, more. Take out the cake from its mould and pour the melted chocolate. 

It's done!!
